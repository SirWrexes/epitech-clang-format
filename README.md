# EPITECH CLang-Format config
## Because Norminettes are all broken as hell.

There are several reasons I wanted to make and share this.

1. First one is that Norminettes are, as said above, all broken.

    They're not updated anymore, they flag tons of false positives,
    They're using a old version of Epitech's coding style that is
    HARD-CODED inside them -- really this sucks and disallows any kind
    of flexibility. And if you know me, you know I LOVE flexible code
2. Moreover, Norminettes are FORBIDDEN... unless you make one yourself.

    Making a parser/syntax checker/linter/style checker/call it whatever
    is a long road that requires a lot of work and is often not worth it.
    It'll teach you very interresting things but I bet you 10k€ that if you're
    not a geius that has 100% at every project ─ and if you are you dont't
    need a norminette ─ your Norminette will end up exactly like NormEZ
    and the likes : broken as hell.
3. CLang and its tools are awesome !

    You should really take time to check them out, it's worth you while.
    CLang is an amazing compiler : faster than GCC, with much more eligible
    error/warning messages, and of course it's GCC compatible, meaning
    that GCC compile options still work with it, attributes and stuff too.
4. I'll probably have typed more text in this README than in my config

    Which proves how easy it is to have a fully functional way of
    making both your C and C++ code Epitech Style compliant, and to
    [integrate it with your favorite editor/IDE](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html).
